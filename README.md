# gaigen-clojure

A rewrite of gaigen http://g25.sourceforge.net/ in clojure.
The gaigen code generator seems to be abandoned.
That is too bad, I need a port to clojure so this
project is my effort to get some life back in gaigen as
well as providing what is needed for the freed-linkage-assembler.

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/phreed/gaigen-clojure.

## Usage

Can be run as a standalone application for generating
non-clojure outputs or as a macro library for use in clojure.

    $ java -jar gafcs-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

## Options

Still under development.
